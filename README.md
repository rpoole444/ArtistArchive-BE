## Project Spec
[Showcase Spec Click Here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/showcase.html)

## Abstract 

This project is a custom built backend, with a GET methods, attached to a custom tables of customized data containing videos and biography of inspiring artists. I built a frontend where you can find the repo [HERE](https://github.com/rpoole444/ArtistArchive-FE) I built both the backend and the frontend in only a week. 
## Learning Goals

- Build Backend using Express
- Gain competency with Backend flow and fundamentals
- Practice and Deploy our backend using Heroku
- Create DRY and clean code!

## Preview 

## Wins & Challenges

- Successfully built a full stack app!
- successfully organized our BE architecture to run efficiently and for devs to easily understand! 
- Creating a fresh custom backend and then manipulating the data using React was a learning curve, but ultimately it was super cool to build a full stack app!
